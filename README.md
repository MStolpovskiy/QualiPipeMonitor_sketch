A sketch for the future QualiPipe monitor.

# Used technologies:
- html to display the outputs
- javascript in some places, to render some elements dynamically
- python, because it's easy
- flask to connect back and frontends
- yaml for plot specifications
- plotly for plotting,
because its easy to embed in html
(although I didn't try it with matplotlib),
it is interactive and 
it looks cool.

# Already some questions:
- I'm not sure if it will be possible to continue with plotly,
at least the camera view won't be straightforward, I think.
- The user plotting is cool, but it is so limited:
for example, masking is only very trivial.
No possibility to combine variables.
And I don't see how it would be possible to do!
